# Heyflow FE Assignment

- This project was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- The interactive JSON functional React component is fully implemented to meet the success criteria.
- The custom checkbox is created via HTML and CSS only and sits beneath React's VDOM.

Note: NPM can be used instead of PNPM but you might need to add 'run' before the script key depending on your version of NPM.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm i && pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
